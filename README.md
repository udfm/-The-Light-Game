# -The-Light-Game
This game is entirely text based. The horror game is my first python game so it may not be perfect.  when the game asks you to type a option type the number "1" or "2" . 
I had to use Google colab because I didn't know how to do anything else. If you run into any problems rerun the code.
To actually play the game you have to click on the "The_light.ipynb" file and click "Open with google colab" then run the code.
